## Loading and preprocessing the data

data <- read.csv("./activity.csv")
sum <- aggregate(data$steps, by=data["date"], FUN=sum)
colnames(sum) <- c("date", "sum of steps")

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

hist(sum$"sum of steps", col = "red", main = "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day", xlab = "Steps")
mean <- mean(sum$"sum of steps", na.rm = TRUE)
median <- median(sum$"sum of steps", na.rm = TRUE)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

average <- aggregate(data$steps, by=data["interval"], FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
colnames(average) <- c("interval", "average of steps")
plot(average$interval, average$"average of steps", type = "l")
max <- (average[which.max(average$"average of steps"), ])$interval

## Imputing missing values

missingSteps <- sum(is.na(data$steps))
missingDates <- sum(is.na(data$date))
missingInterval <- sum(is.na(data$interval))

rowsNA <- sum(!complete.cases(data))

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
